# Microservices_with_Docker_Kubernetes

- Developed **RESTful** web services and REST API. This project combined Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA. And created **Microservices**.

- There are two parts - RESTful web services and Microservices

- RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.

- First, I implemented these resources with multiple features - versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. it's a practice in designing RESTful web services.

- I used Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server.

- Second, I implemented microservices using Spring Cloud.

- I established communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. Centralized the configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. Implemented Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. Created fault tolerant microservices with Zipkin.

- Finally, built containers for microservices built using Docker and Spring Cloud. And orchestrated microservices with Kubernetes.
